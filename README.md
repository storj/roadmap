# Storj Public Roadmap
:sparkle: View the [official Storj Public Product Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/storj/projects/23)

In keeping with one of our core company values of transparency, we’re excited to share our public product roadmap to give you visibility into our key product focus and feature priorities. Whether you’re a developer, CTO, partner, Web3 enthusiast, community member, and/or user, you can see planned features and timelines designed to improve and enhance object storage. This repository is designed to work in conjunction with our [open development process](https://www.storj.io/blog/storj-open-development-announcement), for which we’re always looking for comments, feedback, and, of course, code contribution.  We’re also looking forward to feedback on how to improve the way we communicate, present, and collaborate on the roadmap over time.

In each issue, you can read about the description of the feature and the problem it’s designed to solve. New discoveries and revised priorities are anticipated—and sometimes bodies of work take longer than expected or get reprioritized in preference of more impactful features. The product team will be updating this roadmap and responding to comments on planned issues. 

If you have any questions or feedback about a specific issue on this roadmap please contribute by commenting on the issue. You can also share general feedback on our forum.
