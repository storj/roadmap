# Storj Public Roadmap
:sparkle: View the [official Storj Public Product Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/storj/projects/23)


We are excited to share our public product roadmap with the community of customers, users, builders, and decentralized storage enthusiasts. This roadmap is intended to provide key understandings of the features and capabilities that are being built for the storage layer of the decentralized web. 

This repository is designed to work in conjunction with our open development process to communicate the direction of the roadmap. We expect to make improvements to the way we communicate, present, and collaborate on the roadmap with the community over time.

As part of our [open development process](https://www.storj.io/blog/storj-open-development-announcement), we’re always looking for comments, feedback and, of course, code contribution.  In this first version of the public roadmap, we’ve chosen to make existing issues read-only, but open for conversations.

In each issue you can read about the description of the feature and the problem it’s designed to solve. New discoveries and priorities are anticipated—and sometimes bodies of work take longer than expected or get reprioritized in preference to more impactful features. The product team will be updating this roadmap and responding to comments on planned issues. 

If you have any questions or feedback about a specific issue on this roadmap please contribute by commenting on the issue. You can also share general feedback on our [forum](https://forum.storj.io/).

### Guide to the roadmap

How to read the Roadmap: 
- The column the issue is in is when the functionality is expected to be finished. 
- When a team starts work on an issue it will be updated with corresponding links to product requirement documents, blueprints, GitHub milestones. 
- As work on issues starts, the expected completion quarter may change. Please see our disclaimer below.
