# Product Requirements Document Template


## Objective

Explain the customer problem we are solving and how it relates to our vision, goals, and initiatives. This will establish the high-level purpose of what we want to accomplish and for whom. This also keeps the broader team focused on building features that delight our customers.

- list what we want to do
- why we want to do it
- and who needs it
- Summarize the vision - Where we want our product to be in the future
- Goals - List product goals with a time frame and success metric
- Initiatives - List strategic product initiatives
- Personas - Who the product is for


## Features

Define each feature (or user story) that will be delivered in the release. This section of the PRD is where you explain exactly what needs to be built so the development team can determine how best to implement it

- Name of the new feature or user story
- Description of what the new feature will do
- Task or action the user wants to accomplish
- Pain point or challenge
- How the proposed solution helps the user
- Business, user, or technical assumptions
- Anything that is out of scope for this feature
- Conditions of acceptance

## Release

Use the release section of the PRD to outline what will be delivered and when. This helps internal teams understand the scope and timeline of the release so they can plan their work. Capture key milestones and dependencies to keep everyone on track

- Release name
- Release date
- Initiative that the release relates to
- List the key features included in the release
- Release milestones
- Release dependencies

## User flow and design

Visual wireframes and mockups in your PRD to show what the feature will look like and where it fits on the overall sitemap or page. This helps engineering understand exactly what you are envisioning and how the functionality should be implemented


## Analytics

Establish upfront how you will measure the success of your features. Create a hypothesis about the impact you think a feature will have so you can assess whether it achieves the desired results

What result we are expecting when we deliver it:

- We believe <this feature> will achieve <this outcome>.
- Include an overall success metric to evaluate whether or not your hypothesis was correct.


## Future work

Include high-level information about future roadmap plans for your product in the PRD. Include any relevant information that helps the team understand how the product may evolve over time
